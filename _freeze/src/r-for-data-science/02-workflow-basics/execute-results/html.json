I took note for those that were new to me or found useful to remind myself with.\n\n\n## Comments\n\nUse comments to explain the *why* of your code, eg, you changed the default value of a parameter of a function from say `.2` to `.9`, why?\n\n\n## Nameing Objects Rules\n\n- Allowed characters when naming objects\n  - letters\n  - numbers\n  - `_`\n  - `.`\n- All names must start with a letter\n- R is case-sensitive, ie, `var`, `Var`, and `VAR` are different names\n",
