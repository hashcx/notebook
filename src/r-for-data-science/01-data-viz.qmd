## Introduction

This page introduces the plot creation vocabulary step by step

## Clear Workspace

Always start by clearing the workspace. This ensure objects created in other files are not used used here.

```{r}
#| include: true
#| results: 'hide'

rm(list = ls())
```

## Packages {#sec-packages}

### List

List all the packages that will be used in this script.

```{r List of Used Packages}
#| include: true
#| echo: true
#| error: true

packages = c("palmerpenguins", 'ggthemes', 'ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'here', 'knitr')
```

### Install Missing

Any missing package will be installed automatically. This ensure smoother execution when run by others.

```{r Install Missing Packages}
#| include: true
#| echo: true
#| error: true

# Do NOT modify
install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))
```

### Load

Load all packages

```{r Load Packages}
#| include: true
#| echo: false
#| error: true

# Do NOT modify
lapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

## Plot Creation Process

### Load Dataset

The `penguins` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package will be used for plotting. Typically, the package is loaded using the `library` function as shown in the code chunk below. However, a better approach is the one outlined in @sec-packages.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(palmerpenguins)
```

Explore the dataset

```{r}
#| include: true
#| output: true
help(penguins)
```

Explore the dataset differently

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(penguins)
```

### Load Plotting Package

The `ggplot2` package will be used for plotting. The package is typically loaded using the `library` function as shown in the code chunk below. However, a better approach is the one outlined in @sec-packages.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(ggplot2)
```

### Create `ggplot` object

Create an empty canvas by instantiating a `ggplot` object using the `ggplot()` function.

```{r}
ggplot()
```

### Link Dataset

Link the dataset with the instantiated `ggplot` object using the `data` parameter.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins)
```

### Map Two Variables

Specify which of the variables in the dataset will be used as the plot aesthetics (visual properties) using the `mapping` argument done via the `aes()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))
```

### Display Data

Specify how the data (observations) will be represented geometrically on the plot, eg, bars, points, or line. The functions starting with `geom_` is used for this purpose. These functions add layer of the selected geometric object to the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Map Third Variables

Other variables in the dataset can be linked to plot aesthetics (visual properties) using the `mapping` argument done via the `aes()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
) +
  geom_point()
```

### Display Three Trendlines

More geometric representations for the data can be specified using the functions starting with `geom_` which will add layer of the selected geometric object to the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Display One Trendline

The aesthetic mapping defined in the `ggplot()` function is *global* meaning that all the `geom_()` functions inherit it. However, the aesthetic mapping defined in the `geom_()` functions are *local*, ie, not shared with other `gemo_()` functions.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Map One Variable Twice

We can link the same variable to multiple plot aesthetics (visual properties) using the `mapping` parameter done via the `aes()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Fix Labels

The `labs()` function can be used to make the plot more accessible. The function will add new layer to the plot and the following items can be added to the layer using the corresponding parameters

-   a title using the `title` parameter
-   a sub-title, if necessary, using the `subtitle` parameter
-   x-axis title using the `x` parameter
-   y-axis title using the `y` parameter
-   data-series label or legend using the `color` and/or `shape` parameters

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = 'Palmer Three Species Penguins',
    subtitle = 'The flipper length has a moderattly strong positive linear relationship with the body mass',
    x = 'Fliper length (mm)',
    y = 'Body mass (g)',
    shape = 'Species',
    color = 'Species'
  )
```

Other types of texts can be added using other functions. The other types of texts are:

-   x-axis label
-   y-axis label
-   data labels, if necessary
-   annotation for interesting or important data, if exist

### Ensure Color-blind Safe

Make the plot more color-blind safe by using the `scale_color_colorblind()` function from the `ggthemes` package which will add new layer to the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = 'Palmer Three Species Penguins',
    subtitle = 'The flipper length has a moderattly strong positive linear relationship with the body mass',
    x = 'Fliper length (mm)',
    y = 'Body mass (g)',
    shape = 'Species',
    color = 'Species'
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

### Can Call Implicitly

The first one or two arguments of functions are so important that scientists should know them by heart. Hence, to save some typing, the name of these arguments are usually omitted and only the values assigned to them are kept, ie, the names becomes implicit and no more explicit. Hence, the above call can be written as follows--the arguments `data` and `mapping` were omitted.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = 'Palmer Three Species Penguins',
    subtitle = 'The flipper length has a moderattly strong positive linear relationship with the body mass',
    x = 'Fliper length (mm)',
    y = 'Body mass (g)',
    shape = 'Species',
    color = 'Species'
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

### Use Pipe Operator

The pipe operator `\>` (shortcut: `Ctrl+M`) can be used to make the code tidy. The above code can be re-written as follow--notice the dataset was pulled before the call to the `ggplot()` function.

```{r}
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = 'Palmer Three Species Penguins',
    subtitle = 'The flipper length has a moderattly strong positive linear relationship with the body mass',
    x = 'Fliper length (mm)',
    y = 'Body mass (g)',
    shape = 'Species',
    color = 'Species'
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

## Visualizing Distribution

### Categorical Variables

Plot options to visualize how a categorical variable is distributed:

-   bar chart, if the counts are not computed, using `gemo_bar()` function
-   column chart, if the counts are computed, `gemo_col()` function

### Numerical Variables

Plot options to visualize how a numerical (discrete or continuous) variable is distributed:

-   histogram, using `geom_histogram()` function

::: callout-note
#### Histogram Bin Width

The bin width of the histogram is in the unit of the variable mapped to the plot `x` (or `y`) aesthetic (visual property)
:::

-   density plot, using `geom_density()` function
-   boxplot, using `geom_boplot()` function

::: callout-note
#### Boxplot Components

As described beautifully in [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize#visualizing-relationships), a boxplot consists of:

1.  A box that describes the range of the middle half of the data, a distance known as the interquartile range (IQR), stretching from the 25th percentile of the distribution to the 75th percentile.

2.  A line in the middle of the box displaying the median, ie, the 50th percentile, of the distribution.

3.  The box and the line give sense of the spread of the distribution and whether or not the distribution is symmetric about the median or skewed to one side

4.  Visual points that display the observations that fall more than 1.5 time the IQR from either edge of the box. These outlying points (hence called outliers) are unusual so are plotted individually

5.  A whisker that extend from each end of the box and goes to the farthest non-outlier point in the distribution

Below is the diagram from [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize#visualizing-relationships) showing the above components and how the boxpot is created.

## Visualizing Relationships

### One Categorical + One Numerical

For each category of the categorical variable, We can use any of the plot options mentioned above for the numerical variables

### Two Categoricals

Each category of one of the categorical variables will be placed on the x-axis (or the y-axis) by mapping it to the plot `x` (or `y`) aesthetic (visual property) of the `geom_bar()` and the distribution of the categories of the other categorical variables by mapping it to the plot `fill` aesthetic (visual property). The second variable can be shown as:

-   pure counts (stacked bar chart), or
-   percentages (percent stack bar chart) by setting the `position` attribute of the `geom_bar()` to `fill`.

### Two Numerical

Plot options to show the relationship between two numerical variables are:

-   Scatter plot using the `geom_point()` function
-   trend line using `geom_smooth()` function
-   line graph using `geom_line()` function if one of the variables is monotonic, eg, time or date.

### Three or More Variables

To visualize 3+ variables, We can either

-   map variables to other aesthetics of the plot, eg, *color*, *size*, and *shape*
-   split plot into facets, subplots that each display one subset of the data, based on a categorical variable using `facet_wrap()` function where its first argument is a formula created using `~` followed by a (categorical) variable name.
