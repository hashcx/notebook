# R/rmd/qmd Files

It is advisable to do followings at the beginning of each code file

## Clean Workspace

Always start by clearing the workspace to ensure objects created in other files are not used in the current file.

```{r}
#| eval: false

rm(list = ls())
```


## Insall & Load Packages

Although people may not like installing packages on their machines automatically for different reasons, I prefer this route for myself because I use multiple machines and install packages one at a time (after the code breaks multiple time because of the missing packages) is annoying.

Step 1: Store all needed packages to a variables:

```{r}
#| eval: false

packages <- c("here", "tidyverse", "janitor")
```


Step 2: Install missing packages, if any

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))

```

Step 3: Load packages in one go


```{r Load Packages}
#| eval: false

lapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
```
