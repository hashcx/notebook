# Tips

## Clean Workspace @ Start

Always start by clearing the workspace to ensure objects created by other files are not used here.

```{r}
#| eval: false

rm(list = ls())
```


## Insalling Missing Pckages

Although people may not like installing packages on their machines automatically for different reasons, I prefer this route for myself because I use multiple machines and install packages one at a time (after the code breaks multiple time because of the missing packages) is annoying.

Step 1: Store all needed packages to a variables:

```{r}
#| eval: false

packages <- c("here", "tidyverse", "janitor")
```


Step 2: Install missing packages

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))

```

## Loading Packages

We can then load all the packages using one line.

```{r Load Packages}
#| eval: false

lapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
```
