# WIP: Web Scrap Mac Class Schedule

## Introduction

This is a work-in-progress to scarp the class schedule from Macalester's Registrar website.

## Observations

### URL

The base URL of the class schedule is

```markdown
https://macadmsys.macalester.edu/macssb/customPage/page/classSchedule?term=<year><term code>
```

where `<year>` is the latest year of academic year, 2026 for the 2025/26 year; and `<term code>` is `10` for fall and `30` for spring.  For example, to get the class schedule for the fall semester of 2025/2026 academic year, the URL would be

```markdown
https://macadmsys.macalester.edu/macssb/customPage/page/classSchedule?term=202610
```

and for the spring semester of the same year, the URL of the class schedule would be

```markdown
https://macadmsys.macalester.edu/macssb/customPage/page/classSchedule?term=202630
```

### Load

The page will take few seconds to load the class schedule which be taking into consideration when scapping.
