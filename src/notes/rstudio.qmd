## Notes

-   **Working Directory** is the location where R looks for files and store files. RStudio showed this location at the top of the *console* window. The location can be printed to the console using the R command `getwd()` (get working directory).
- When creating project using RStudio, a file with the extension `.Rproj` will be created.  Clicking this file will automatically open the project in RStudio.
