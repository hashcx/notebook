## Introduction

This page covers basic concepts when working with R.  I took note for those that were new to me or found useful to remind myself with.


## Comments

Use comments to explain the *why* of your code, eg, you changed the default value of a parameter of a function from say `.2` to `.9`, why?


## Nameing Objects Rules

- Allowed characters when naming objects
  - letters
  - numbers
  - `_`
  - `.`
- All names must start with a letter
- R is case-sensitive, ie, `var`, `Var`, and `VAR` are different names
