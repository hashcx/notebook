Always start by clearing the workspace. This ensure objects created in other files are not used used here.

#### Installing Packages on Other People Machine

Be aware the people may not like installing packages into their machine automatically.  This might break some of their previous code.

:::

```{r Install Missing Packages}
#| include: true
#| echo: true
#| error: true

# Do NOT modify
install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))
```

### Load {-}

Load all packages

```{r Load Packages}
#| include: true
#| echo: true
#| error: true

# Do NOT modify
lapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
```


## Introduction

This page covers basic concepts when working with R.  I took note for those that were new to me or found useful to remind myself with.


## Comments

Use comments to explain the *why* of your code, eg, you changed the default value of a parameter of a function from say `.2` to `.9`, why?


## Nameing Objects Rules

- Allowed characters when naming objects
  - letters
  - numbers
  - `_`
  - `.`
- All names must start with a letter
- R is case-sensitive, ie, `var`, `Var`, and `VAR` are different names
